### Eliminated much of the hand configuration, unpack the files where 
### you want them to live, then run the config.bsh script. That will 
### automatically configure the application to run from the directory 
### where it is and will create an alias file, add the alias file 
### command to your .bashrc file and you're all set! 
### 
### Notes: Requires PHP, the scripts presume you have firefox, if not 
###        you will have to edit the alias to your favorite web browser. 
### 
### E.g. After it's set up, run it as: 
###     $> i2h coreutils wc invocation
